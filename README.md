# json2swift

Tools to generate Swift code from JSON.

### Use case

You have a server API which returns JSON, but you don't want to write all the boilerplate Swift code yourself just to read responses from the API.

### Running locally

* Make sure you have NodeJS installed
* Clone the repository
* npm install
* ./test.sh

Not tested on any other platform than Mac OS X 10.11. :-)
